# Commodore VIC-20 Restored Cartridge Box Collection by 20Goto10

This is a media collection of front covers of the game cartridge boxes Commodore launched for the VIC-20.

The VIC-20 was my first computer, and with the lack of good artwork for cartridge games available, I decided to create these myself. The old cartridge boxes were fragile and had a habit of tearing and creasing easily, which made sourcing good reference art quite difficult. It meant that the reference scans I sourced were relatively low resolution, meaning the box graphics, logos and typography all had to be rebuilt (fonts matched, each game description rebuilt line by line to match the original (including font inconsistencies and interesting justified text alignments!), sleeve artwork upscaled and tidied up, colour corrected, scan perspectives fixed, card textures added. 

These covers are all provided as PNGs at 644px wide. If there's a desire for these at higher resolutions I can export at a much higher resolution.

If you have any other VIC-20 requests, or can help in providing reference scans, get in touch. There is much more work to do.

The VIC-20 needs our love! I hope you find these useful and enjoy them as much I did creating them.
